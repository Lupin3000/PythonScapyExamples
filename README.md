# Python 3 - Scapy scripts

## Why this repository?

I created this repository to learn Python incl. Scapy (_self study_) and to provide some simple scripts for my [suitcases](https://softwaretester.info/suitcases-full-of-fun/). You can read all about Python Scapy [here](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). If you want, you are very welcome to participate. Most of the scripts can still be improved or expanded.

**Very Important**

The author of these scripts (_code_) take no responsibility for your use or misuse! Respect the law in your country/location/area! The information included at this repository is for educational purposes only!
